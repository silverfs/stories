Sorry for the late post. A lot happened after the happenings described down below, and thus time was scarce. Let's dive right in.

# Idul Fitri

  

Having tried doing Ramadan (fasting) last year in my home country, I couldn't help and try it for myself here. It's quite hard to do in the Netherlands, as it can get dark quite late in the evening. Here in Indonesia however, it felt really simple in comparison. Iftar – or "buka puasa" – was here between 17:45 and 17:30 at the very end. Even without eating breakfast, it kinda felt like a breeze going through it. Now that I experienced it, I don't feel like doing it again, because I just love food, but I did experience some nice memories, like breaking the fast with local students and enjoying delicacies and customs of different regions.

  

Ampel is a nice place if you want to try out middle eastern food and culture. I'm too lazy to explain it with my own words, so here is Google Map's description:

> The city’s historic Arab quarter, Ampel centers on Masjid Sunan Ampel, a 19th-century mosque with polished teak pillars and a saint’s tomb. Tiny eateries serve Middle Eastern fare like kebabs and spicy lamb rice, while relaxed coffee shops and roadside snack stalls cater to a late-night crowd. Shops in souklike Pasar Ampel market specialize in spices, traditional clothing, and religious items.

When the end of Ramadan came, I decided to travel to Jakarta to visit my family.

  

# Family visit

Jakarta times were a blast. I saw family members I haven't seen in over 10 years and spent great quality time there. I also went to the aquarium and visited a pen pal.

Yeah... That's basically it in a nutshell. Though, don't be too disappointed, as I have more posts in thee making!

Until soon!
