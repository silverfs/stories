üìç__Jl. Trunojoyo No.76, DR. Soetomo, Kec. Tegalsari, Surabaya, Jawa Timur 60264, Indonesia:__

K√ºrshtop Chimney Cake resides in a small street in a quite peculiar neighborhood. From ASEEC tower / Airlangga University Campus B, you drive 15 minutes with a car or around 10 with a motorcycle to get there. There's also a K√ºrshtop in the Pakuwon Trade Center, but as I didn't go there, it only makes sense to not focus on that one right now.

  

So what do they sell? Prepare yourself to pronounce "__K√ºrt≈ëskal√°cs,__" or sometimes spoken as __Kurtosh__ (I think). This Hungarian "Cake" ‚Äì or pastry ‚Äì originally came from Romania, or what that area was called before: Sz√©kely Land. This sweet treat is said to be quite old, dating back to as far as 1781.

This small shop in middle Surabaya has quite a vibe to it. The pastry was also really good :) ... The owners of the shop did not hesitate to tell us all about it, so let's see what I ate this time.

K√ºrt≈ëskal√°cs is made by wrapping a strip of sweet, yeast dough around a cylindrical spit (seen in the picture above), which is then rolled in a layer of sugar. The dough is roasted over an open flame or in this case baked in a mini oven and roasted with a small flamethrower, until the sugar caramelizes, forming a crispy, golden crust. Often, the finished cake is rolled in additional toppings like cinnamon, nuts, or cocoa powder. The result is a hollow, cylindrical treat that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

There were different kinds of extra coatings, but I chose to go with the original one, which was brown sugar and cinnamon. I tried some others from friends and they were all just as good.

See the menu down below for the tastes and prices (May, 2024). I'd say they're good prices for the products you get. Very satisfied. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area! And that's not all they have. They also sell different baked goods depending on their mood. Don't miss out on that either!
