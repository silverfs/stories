Yet again, we wanted to leave Surabaya to explore different regions. This time, it was Mojokerto. A small city 40 km from Surabaya, which translates to 40-60 minutes by train. Wanting to spend an entire day there, we departed early in the morning.

We did a bit of research, but there were not a lot of activities to do in the city; Mostly sight-seeing ventures. The first place we went to was the lying Buddha, or "Buddha Tidur Mojokerto." It was such a peaceful and quiet place. Although it being really early in the morning might have contributed to the atmosphere. It is a tree-filled temple area known for its many statues.

## Brahu Temple

Next of, we walked in the now scorching sun to the Candi Brahu Temple. A restored Buddhist temple built of red brick. The site was very peaceful, undeterred by the many groups of children from school excursions. We got treated to some sate ayam by the teachers and had a lot of fun taking pictures with the classes! \\(_ˊᗜˋ_)/

## A mountain (again)

Last but definitely not least, we decided to climb a random mountain we found on the map, to cool ourselves off in a waterfall. It was a 1.5 hour drive, and the steep hike was tiring to say the least. After venturing through overgrown pathways, we finally arrived at the waterfall. It was a bit smaller than expected, but we were happy that there was water. It was a tough, but fulfilling climb. (and nice scenery as well).

Trips like these are definitely a must when you spend such a long time in the same city, especially when it's Surabaya. At a certain stage, you need a change of scenery. Go out there and don't forget to be adventurous. It makes life better than it already was.
