On January the 29th, I finally departed to Indonesia for an "Exchange Program" at a university in Surabaya, which is the second-largest city in the country. The city may also be referred to as "The city of heroes", as it played a big role in Indonesia's fight for independence.  
I'll be staying here 5 to 6 months, so updates on anything will be done from here when I have the time. The time zone is `UTC/GMT +7 hours`, a noticeable difference compared to the Netherlands, but I was able to adjust quickly.

Next to the normal photos being taken in Indonesia, I will also practice more with vintage-looking shots. Therefore, I created 2 albums that will be continuously updated along my journey. One is called [That Vintage Look](https://lychee.shiruvaaa.net/gallery#O6MbOJK0SZba3r4HnYOEmm69), and the other is [Indonesia Abroad](https://lychee.shiruvaaa.net/gallery#fE5qNI68zQ0k0732BKDr3sIk). You can check them from time to time, or wait for a new blog entry to see some highlights.

My first meal was Rawon, which is a type of beef soup and very tasty. The way they make it is vastly different from how my mother makes it, with the most noticeable difference the meat itself. It is like they were marinated and shortly baked in a mixture of kecap manis and more stuff; I'll definitely eat this again. These two friendly ladies prepared my first meal here and after exchanging some photos, I headed back for my first night in this huge city.

The nights after, I started eating other necessities like sate ayam/kambing ðŸ¤¤... I may be doing a photo-shoot of that in the future.

Anyway, there are many more pictures to come, so I'll leave it at this. As usual, you can view all photo's at my gallery, so don't hesitate to check them out!

Cheers! âœ¨
