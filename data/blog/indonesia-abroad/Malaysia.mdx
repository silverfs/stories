Randomly deciding to go on a short city trip to Malaysia for a few days? Why not. I was in the area anyway :P

4 days in Kuala Lumpur was a blast and a decision I did not regret. I really wanted to explore more of the country, but I couldn't find the time in those 4 days, so that will have to wait for a different trip somewhere in the future. Here are some photos!

Jalan Petaling (Petaling Street) in Kuala Lumpur is a feast for the senses, especially if you're armed with a camera and an empty stomach like I was. The region in which this street is located is called Chinatown KL, and is a generally vibrant space full of a wide range of different people.

Yeah, I forgot where exactly this temple was located, but it was such a beautiful one! When we were there,  a wedding photo shoot was done in between the normal temple ceremony sessions and looked pretty cool!

## Batu Caves


The Batu Caves, located north of KL, were really cool to take pictures of/in. It features a giant statue  of Lord Murugan, which is apparently the Hindu god of war and victory. The statue is a whopping 40 meters tall!

Oh, and if you didn't notice yet, there are a lot of monkey's. Don't fret, as they are more friendly than the ones on Bali (most of the time...) (ó﹏ò｡)

The interior of the cave showcases a spectacular view of an immense limestone temples, and shrines.

## KL Street Vibes

Nightlife in Kuala Lumpur shouldn't be a bore, as there's something to do on every corner and every street. From late-night food markets to mini festivals. What struck me the most was the aesthetic of the street looks, as you can see below.

I highly recommend you to go visit [Jalan Alor Street Food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YnRWT3P11PSsSw658) for a great street food experience. It gets very crowded, but there are loads of options to choose from, with cheap and delicious snacks and dishes!

That's all for now again. See you soon :p
