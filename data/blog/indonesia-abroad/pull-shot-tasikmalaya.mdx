üìç__Jl. Seladarma No.58, Tawangsari, Tasikmalaya, Indonesia:__

In a small but relatable looking neighborhood in Tasikmalaya, Indonesia, exists a coffee shop called "Pull & Shot Coffee." It has 2 buildings, with another coffee shop in between on the corner of the street. The coffee shop opens from 6 am and closes around 10 pm, which is pretty early in the evening for my taste, but a standard in Indonesia.

I went here at around 8 am to eat some breakfast and drink some coffee. Let's have a look shall we?

****Filter Coffee (Local brew) Tier 2 (see cover picture) - Rp35.000****: Despite the lack of knowledge from the barista when asked what the difference was between tier 1 and tier 2 filter coffee, the taste was not bad at all! Sadly, because of the barista's lack of knowledge about coffee, taste, or beans, I had to take a wild guess. It's neither super strong nor weak. Considering there is a tier 1... It's a bit on the "sweeter" side, or less bitter than I'm used to for some americano's, so it didn't necessarily have that "local vibe" to it. I did get a nice quantity for what I paid.

****Nasi sapi lada hitam (see cover picture) - Rp65.000****: Nice overall, but nothing particularly special. A little plain even. It would've been better if the carrots were cooked with the stew at the end, just like in Japanese curry or something similar. It had a pleasant taste to eat for breakfast. Good quantity as well.

****BBQ hot wings - Rp55.000****: Fries are barely sprinkled with salt - it's a preference thing - and are topped with some basil. No sauce, nothing fancy. At least they were not french fries. Hot wings were as expected: not really hot wings and mostly just normal wings with BBQ sauce flavor.

****Fruit Pancake - Rp(i forgorüíÄ)****: Was room temperature: I would've preferred it to be a little warmer. It had whipped cream, blueberry, strawberry, and some honey-icing stuff. Pretty solid.

I had a ****caramel latte afterwards - Rp32.000****: a little bit on the expensive side, but quite a decent taste. No explicit comment aside from this one.

The vibe of the coffee shop was really nice. It had lots of plants, and different kinds of seats with enough power outlets. It's a semi-open place, meaning that while there is a roof, it's open on lots of sides. So while there might not be air conditioning everywhere, there is a gentle breeze in most spots. They try to flare up the place with lots of greenery, cozy lights, and wall paintings. Very gezellig!

Here are some more photo's. Until next time!
