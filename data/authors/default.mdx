## Heya! ✌️ I'm known as Shiruvaaa! 🥸

I'm the host of this website. I like traveling, photography, food, cooking, music, and IT related tinkering. Welcome to my blog 😊

I'm currently a Cyber security student and planning to graduate soon. Whenever I have time, I practice photography and record my journey through my [public gallery](https://lychee.shiruvaaa.net) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/shiruvaaa).

## Why a blog in this day and age?

I started writing as a means to record and share the knowledge I gain during my journey in life.
It could include all kinds of topics, but would mostly revolve around my interests.
Writing this blog helps me in organizing my thoughts and ideas, and if I could help or entertain even one other lifeform by sharing my stories, I'd consider it as a win. A quote I thus like to live by:

> The nourishment of the body is food, while the nourishment of the soul is feeding others.

<br />

I hope you enjoy my writings.
